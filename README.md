# TIOZE WEBSITE

## Why did it stop?

I started this project to get some front-end experience, but I chose a technology that didn't let me work as freely as I wanted since I was creating a static website.
I had already made some Django tutorials so I just started coding the website but the way I thought about things wasn't really how it should have been done and I will re-create this in React since I have the experience now.

### Disclaimer:
It still has some great value in me and I will always remember the Django Experience
